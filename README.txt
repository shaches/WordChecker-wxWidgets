This tool takes user input through the GUI and converts it into separated words with multiple additional functionalities:
1: The program counts each word, sorts them with the most frequent word at the top and displays them in the GUI (ready)
2: The program can filter some unwanted words in the output (not ready)
3: Program input and output can be saved as a file in a user-defined location (not ready)

This program only supports std::string as input for now.

Build guides will be added after the basic functionality is ready.
